### Regional Layout (Very Important – Use Exact Placement)

**WEST**

* **Thornwood**: Not a forest. Fertile farmlands, gentle hills, rivers, roads, villages; clearly the safest and most welcoming region. At the center is the town of Thornwood. To the southeast of Thornwood should be the major city of Esfereld. To the north of Thornwood should be the town of Ubechlode.

* **Dimwood**: dark corrupted forest encroaching eastward, twisted trees, fog, shadow influence

**CENTRAL**

* **Rust Wastes**: blasted necromantic wasteland, undead city-state, black spires, ossified terrain, extreme danger
* **Underhearth**: massive underground dwarf-gnome civilization beneath central regions; surface marked by mountain vents, stone doors, rune circles; visually implied, not fully exposed

**NORTH**

* **Broken Peaks**: jagged mountain range with ancient dwarven holds, contested territory
* **Starfall Expanse**: enormous cosmic impact crater, warped land, alien geometry, unstable magic effects
* **Ashen March**: volcanic highlands, lava flows, fire giant warzone; **Ashguard Fortress** holding a narrow pass

**EAST**

* **Singing Wastes**: crystalline desert, refractive sands, faint magical energy patterns, haunted appearance
* **Blackmere Ruins**: marshy battlefield graveyard, broken fortifications, flooded ruins, undead presence

**SOUTH**

* **Midnight Shore**: storm-lashed demon-plagued coastline, dark seas, glowing planar breaches along cliffs

**SOUTHWEST**

* **Verdant Scar**: dense hostile elven jungle, overgrown ruins, aggressive borders, oppressive canopy

### Labeling & Usability Requirements

* All regions **clearly labeled**
* Text must be **legible at full map scale**
* Roads, rivers, mountains, forests clearly distinguished
* No character portraits, no UI elements, no modern fonts
* Map should look suitable for a **boxed-set campaign world**

### Negative Constraints (Strongly Enforced)

* No sci-fi aesthetics
* No photorealism
* No modern typography
* No floating islands
* No abstract shapes
* No bright neon colors
* No random biome placement
