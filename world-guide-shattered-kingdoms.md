# The Shattered Kingdoms: World Guide
*A Dark Fantasy Setting for AD&D*

---

## OVERVIEW

**The Shattered Kingdoms** is a dark fantasy world where ancient civilizations have collapsed, leaving behind ruins, lost knowledge, and dangerous magic. It is a realm where light struggles against shadow, where brave adventurers are desperately needed, and where the sins of the past threaten the fragile present.

**Current Age:** The Age of Reclamation (~100 years after the Darkening)

**Tone:** Dark fantasy with hope; cosmic horror elements; emphasis on light versus shadow; adventurers as essential heroes; constant threats from undead, demons, and shadow corruption.

**Core Themes:**
- Exploration and rediscovery of lost knowledge
- Light versus Shadow (balance, not just good vs evil)
- Redemption and the price of power
- Small points of civilization in a dangerous world
- Heroes as bulwarks against darkness

## HISTORY OF THE SHATTERED KINGDOMS

### THE AGE OF TITANS (Ancient Past)
*"In the beginning, the Titans shaped the world..."*

The primordial age when cosmic entities called Titans ruled the world. These beings embodied fundamental forces: light, shadow, storm, earth, flame, and void. They were neither good nor evil, but alien and powerful beyond mortal comprehension.

**Key Events:**
- **The First Shaping:** Titans created the material world from chaos
- **The War of Light and Shadow:** Umbra, Titan of Shadow, battled Solara, Titan of Light
- **The Great Binding:** Elder races (elves, dwarves, giants) rose up and imprisoned the Titans
- **The Seven Seals:** Umbra was bound in seven locations across the world

**Legacy:**
- Titan ruins dot the landscape, filled with ancient magic
- The prisons holding the Titans remain, though weakened
- Some creatures still worship the Titans as gods
- Titan artifacts grant terrible power but exact heavy prices

---

### THE AGE OF ASCENSION (Ancient History, ~1000-2000 years ago)
*"When mortals learned to build kingdoms..."*

Following the binding of the Titans, mortal races flourished. Seven great kingdoms arose, each representing different aspects of civilization. This was the golden age of the world.

**The Seven Kingdoms:**
1. **Solhaven** - Kingdom of Light, home to paladins and priests
2. **Deepstone** - Dwarven mountain kingdom, masters of craft
3. **Silvermere** - Elven forest realm, keepers of ancient lore
4. **Ironhold** - Human warrior kingdom, defenders of the north
5. **Azuremark** - Kingdom of scholars and mages
6. **Greenwall** - Agricultural heartland, breadbasket of the world
7. **Tidecrown** - Coastal kingdom of merchants and sailors

**Achievements:**
- Grand cities with populations in the tens of thousands
- Sophisticated magical research and education
- Trade networks spanning the known world
- **The Pillars of Heaven** - Gnome-designed magical infrastructure connecting all kingdoms
- The Pillars (archmages who safeguarded magical knowledge and maintained the infrastructure)
- Great works of engineering: roads, aqueducts, lighthouses
- The Pax Regnum - long peace between the kingdoms
- The Luminous Guild (gnomes as neutral diplomats and ward-keepers)

**The Height of Magic:**
- Wizards could teleport between kingdoms using the Pillar network
- Healing magic extended lifespans
- Magical defenses protected major cities
- The University of High Magic in Azuremark
- Communication networks using sending stones
- Gnome-maintained wards prevented shadow corruption and planar breaches

---

### THE AGE OF SHADOW (The Darkening, ~100 years ago)
*"When the world broke..."*

A cataclysmic event known as **The Darkening** shattered the Seven Kingdoms and plunged the world into chaos. The exact cause remains disputed, but the results were devastating.

**The Darkening - What Happened:**
- Prison seals on Umbra weakened simultaneously
- Shadow corruption spread from seven sites across the world
- Magical backlash destroyed major cities
- The sun dimmed for three years (the Long Night)
- Undead rose in unprecedented numbers
- Demons breached weakened barriers between planes
- Approximately 70% of the population perished

**Theories About the Cause:**
1. **The Titan Escape Theory:** Umbra actively weakened his own prison
2. **The Magical Accident Theory:** Archmage experimentation destabilized the seals
3. **The Betrayal Theory:** One of the Pillars deliberately broke the seals
4. **The Natural Cycle Theory:** The prisons simply degraded over time
5. **The Prophecy Theory:** It was fated to happen, a cosmic reset

**The Shadow-Crystals:**
When Umbra's prison was damaged, seven crystalline fragments formed at the sites of the seals. These Shadow-Crystals contain condensed shadow magic and serve as both keys and anchors to Umbra's prison. Their current locations are mostly unknown, though some have been found over the decades.

**The Long Night (Years 0-3 of the Darkening):**
- The sun appeared as a pale disc through shadow-filled skies
- Crops failed; mass starvation
- Shadow-touched creatures multiplied rapidly
- The Seven Kingdoms' armies were destroyed
- Communication between regions ceased
- Most magical knowledge was lost
- The Pillars disappeared or died
- **The Gnome Sacrifice:** 80% of gnomekind died defending the Pillars of Heaven from shadow corruption; their capital Brightspire was completely destroyed

**Immediate Aftermath:**
- Survivors huddled in fortified settlements
- Most major cities abandoned or destroyed
- Trade collapsed; each region isolated
- Rise of the Warlord Period (brutal local tyrants)
- Surviving gnomes fled underground to dwarf holds
- Formation of the Rekindlers (preservers of knowledge, founded by surviving gnomes 50 years after the Darkening)

---

### THE AGE OF RECLAMATION (Current Era, Years 100-present)
*"A time of slow recovery and cautious hope..."*

A century has passed since the Darkening. The worst of the Long Night is over, but the world remains fractured. Small communities struggle to survive, adventurers explore dangerous ruins, and scholars work to recover lost knowledge.

**Current State of the World:**
- Scattered settlements, rarely over 1,000 population
- No unified kingdoms; local lords and mayors rule
- Dangerous wilderness between civilized areas
- Ruins everywhere - sources of treasure and danger
- Undead and shadow corruption still present
- Slow magical renaissance as spellbooks are recovered

**Signs of Hope:**
- Population slowly recovering
- Trade routes re-establishing (heavily guarded)
- The Rekindlers preserving and sharing knowledge
- Adventurers clearing threats and recovering treasures
- Young mages rediscovering lost spells
- Stories of heroes inspiring hope

**Ongoing Threats:**
- **Shadow Corruption:** Lingering effects of the Darkening
- **Undead Hordes:** Animated corpses from the cataclysm
- **Demon Incursions:** Weak spots in planar barriers
- **Bandits and Monsters:** Prey on isolated settlements
- **Cults:** Worship of dark powers, including Umbra
- **Mad Mages:** Wizards driven insane by lost knowledge

## GEOGRAPHY & REGIONS

### THE THORNWOOD REGION (Starting Area)

**General Description:**
A rural frontier region characterized by rolling hills, scattered woodlands, and small farming communities. Located in what was once the western edge of Greenwall Kingdom. Relatively safe compared to many areas, but still threatened by goblins, bandits, and occasional undead.

**Major Settlements:**

**Thornhollow** (Population ~150)
- Small farming village, the campaign's starting point
- Governed by Mayor Grevik
- Key buildings: The Tired Traveler Inn (Mara, innkeeper), general store (Jorren), small temple (Sister Aldara)
- Primary industries: Farming, shepherding, small-scale crafts
- Recent trouble: Goblin raids from the Ruined Tower

**Other Thornwood Settlements:**
- **Millbrook** (~200 pop): Lumber mill, two days north
- **Crossroads** (~300 pop): Trading post, three days east
- **Old Ferry** (~100 pop): Fishing village, river crossing

**Landmarks:**
- **The Ruined Tower:** Vaelith's collapsed wizard tower, now goblin-infested
- **The Thornwood:** Ancient forest, relatively safe but holds secrets
- **The Standing Stones:** Pre-kingdom stone circle, unknown purpose
- **The Old Road:** Crumbling highway from the Age of Ascension

---

### THE UNDERHEARTH

**Type:** Vast underground dwarven-gnomish civilization

**Location:** Deep beneath the Broken Peaks mountains

**Description:**
The greatest surviving civilization in the Shattered Kingdoms. During the Darkening, thousands of surface dwellers fled underground when the shadow consumed the surface. Dwarves sealed the upper levels and retreated deep into the mountains, creating a thriving subterranean realm lit by lava forges and bioluminescent fungi. This is where the gnomes survived the catastrophe, forging unbreakable bonds with their dwarven saviors.

**Population:** ~100,000 dwarves, ~30,000 gnomes, plus surface refugees

**Government:** The Council of Three Thanes (representing the three major holds)

**The Three Major Holds:**

1. **Ironhearth** - Military stronghold
   - Defends against threats from the Forbidden Depths
   - Houses the largest standing army in the world
   - Training grounds for elite warriors
   - Heavily fortified gates control access to surface

2. **Deepforge** - Industrial center
   - Home to most gnome Rekindlers
   - Advanced workshops combining dwarf smithing and gnome innovation
   - The Great Forge creates powerful artifacts
   - Steam-powered machinery and clockwork automation
   - Best metalwork in the world

3. **Stonevault** - Agricultural hub
   - Vast fungal farms feed the population
   - Underground lakes and aquifers
   - Medicinal herb cultivation
   - Breweries and distilleries

**The Deep Roads:**
Ancient highway system connecting the holds. Some sections have been lost or sealed due to dangers from below. Reclaiming and securing the Deep Roads is an ongoing priority.

**The Forbidden Depths:**
Sealed lowest levels where something terrible stirs. The source of occasional aberration attacks. The Council forbids exploration, but rumors persist of ancient treasures and darker secrets.

**The Rekindlers Guild:**
Elite organization of gnome and dwarf scholars dedicated to preserving and recovering knowledge from before the Darkening. Led by Master Gearheart from his workshop in Deepforge. They are actively seeking magical artifacts, ancient texts, and anything that can help rebuild civilization.

**Key Features:**
- Most advanced technology in the world
- Extensive libraries preserving pre-Darkening knowledge
- Safe from most surface threats (but not all underground ones)
- Active trade with surface settlements via guarded caravans
- Center of magical research and artifact creation
- Training facility for new Rekindlers

**Dwarf-Gnome Relations:**
The bonds forged during the Darkening are unbreakable. Gnomes have full citizenship and high status in the Underhearth. Many mixed families exist, with gnomes and dwarves intermarrying and raising children together. Dwarves remember how gnomes' resistance to shadow corruption saved countless lives during the darkest days.

**Current Projects:**
- Understanding shadow corruption and developing purification methods
- Recreating lost magical techniques from pre-Darkening
- Mapping old kingdom ruins on the surface
- Restoring sections of the ancient Pillar network
- Securing and expanding the Deep Roads

---

### THE BLACKMERE RUINS

**Location:** Three weeks' journey east of Thornwood

**Description:**
Site of a major battle during the Darkening. An entire army of 10,000 soldiers fell here when shadow corruption swept across the battlefield. The ruins are haunted by undead and shadow-touched creatures.

**Current State:**
- Mass graves and skeletal remains
- Collapsed fortifications
- Shadow corruption still palpable
- Rumored to contain a Shadow-Crystal
- Extremely dangerous; few who enter return

---

### THE TITAN'S HOLLOW

**Location:** Unknown, but referenced in ancient texts

**Description:**
One of the seven prison sites of Umbra, Titan of Shadow. Its exact location has been lost, but it's believed to be in a region of permanent twilight where shadow corruption is strongest.

**Characteristics:**
- Perpetual gloom
- Reality behaves strangely
- Home to powerful shadow creatures
- Contains one of the seven seals
- Possibly holds a Shadow-Crystal

---

### EXPANDED WORLD REGIONS

The Shattered Kingdoms span a vast and varied world. Beyond the familiar Thornwood and Underhearth, numerous other regions exist, each with unique challenges and opportunities.

---

#### THE STARFALL EXPANSE

**Type:** Contested magical wasteland

**Location:** Northern territories, beyond the Broken Peaks

**Description:**
A vast crater where a celestial fragment crashed during the Darkening. The impact created a kilometers-wide depression now filled with glowing crystalline growths that radiate strange stellar magic. The area is both wondrous and deadly.

**Key Features:**
- **Starmetal Deposits:** Rare metallic fragments that can harm demons and undead
- **Cosmic Crystals:** Components for powerful enchantments
- **Reality Distortions:** Near the crater center, physics behaves strangely
- **Aberrations:** Cosmic radiation spawns otherworldly creatures
- **The Stargazers Cult:** Worships the fallen star as a divine omen

**Dangers:**
- Hostile aberrations (star spawn, gibbering mouthers)
- Unstable magic zones
- Competing expeditions from various factions
- Cultist attacks on "unbelievers"

**Gnome Role:**
Rekindlers maintain a fortified research station at the crater's edge, studying cosmic magic and believing it might help restore damaged Pillars. Regular research expeditions depart from New Brightspire, though many never return.

---

#### THE SINGING WASTES

**Type:** Haunted crystalline desert

**Location:** Far east, former kingdom of Khelvor

**Description:**
When the kingdom of Khelvor fell during the Darkening, desperate mages attempted a mass transmutation ritual to protect their people. The spell backfired catastrophically, transmuting the entire kingdom—land, cities, and people—into crystalline desert. The "sand" consists of billions of shattered magical crystals that sing in the wind, creating eerie melodies.

**Key Features:**
- **Crystal Sand:** Billions of tiny magical crystals (valuable but dangerous)
- **Phantom Archive:** Time-locked library appears every full moon
- **The Crystal Choir:** Trapped ghost mages whose consciousness remains in the crystals
- **Wild Magic Surges:** Constantly occurring due to unstable magical residue
- **Preserved Ruins:** Buildings made of crystal, perfectly preserved but lifeless

**Dangers:**
- Eerie melodies drive visitors mad over time
- Wild magic can transform or destroy intruders
- Crystal storms that flay flesh from bone
- Ghosts seeking to possess the living
- Extreme temperatures (scorching days, freezing nights)

**Treasures:**
- Pre-Darkening artifacts perfectly preserved in crystal
- Spellbooks in the Phantom Archive
- Rare magical components
- The lost Crown of Khelvor (rumored)

**Gnome Role:**
The Singing Wastes is a pilgrimage site for gnomes—a reminder of magic's terrible power when wielded recklessly. Rekindlers lost many colleagues attempting to study Khelvor's ruins in the early years. Now, only the bravest (or most desperate) gnomes venture into the wastes, usually seeking specific artifacts from the Phantom Archive.

---

#### THE VERDANT SCAR

**Type:** Hostile elven jungle-forest

**Location:** Southwest, former Everwood Sovereignty

**Description:**
When the Darkening began, elven druids used ancient primal magic to make their forests actively hostile to all intruders. Plants grow with supernatural speed and attack trespassers. Nature itself has been weaponized. The magic worked—the Verdant Scar survived—but at tremendous cost to elven society.

**Key Features:**
- **Aggressive Flora:** Carnivorous plants, strangling vines, poisonous thorns
- **Hidden Canopy Cities:** Elven settlements high in the trees, invisible from ground
- **The Heart Tree:** Massive ancient tree at the forest's center, source of the protective magic
- **Rare Ingredients:** Alchemical components found nowhere else
- **Shoot-on-Sight Policy:** Elves attack all non-elven intruders

**Elven Status:**
- Population: ~50,000-100,000 in hidden tree-cities
- Deeply isolationist, blame "short-lived races" for the Darkening
- Maintaining the forest's hostile nature through constant druidic rituals
- Refuse most diplomatic contact
- Will execute trespassers without trial

**Gnome Exception:**
Gnomes are the ONLY non-elves granted safe passage, due to their shared history during the Age of Ascension when gnomes and elves worked together on the Pillars. Some Rekindlers train with elven druids, learning natural magic and purification techniques. This relationship is tenuous but valuable.

---

#### THE ASHEN MARCH

**Type:** Volcanic warzone

**Location:** Far north, beyond the Starfall Expanse

**Description:**
A chain of active volcanoes that erupted during the Darkening and never stopped. Worse, fire giants who slept since the Age of Titans have awakened and now raid southward, threatening all northern settlements.

**Key Features:**
- **Perpetual Eruptions:** Regular volcanic activity
- **Obsidian Fields:** Vast plains of volcanic glass (valuable for weapons and trade)
- **Mount Cinder:** Fire giant king's caldera fortress
- **Ashguard Fortress:** Dwarf-gnome coalition holds the mountain pass
- **Possible Dragon Alliance:** Rumors of red dragons allying with giants

**Ashguard Fortress - The Last Defense:**
- **Defenders:** 500 dwarves, 100 gnomes, 50 human mercenaries
- **Joint Command:** Thane Embercrest (dwarf) & Artificer Brightspark (gnome)
- **Mission:** Hold the pass, prevent giant raids on southern lands
- **Status:** Under constant siege, desperately needs reinforcements

**Fire Giant Threat:**
- King Magmafist rules from Mount Cinder
- Thousands of giants awakened after millennia of sleep
- Building catapults and siege engines
- Planning major offensive southward
- Some worship the Titan of Flame

**Gnome Role:**
Gnomes at Ashguard serve dual purposes—defending the pass and researching volcanic power. Gnome artificers create anti-giant weapons (ballistae, explosive devices, magical defenses). They believe volcanic energy could revolutionize magical engineering if properly harnessed. This research could change the balance of power in the world.

---

#### THE RUST WASTES

**Type:** Undead city-state

**Location:** Former Sunlit Realm capital, central lands

**Description:**
The capital of the Sunlit Realm fell early in the Darkening and became a stronghold for undead. Now ruled by lich lords, it's a nightmare city where the dead outnumber the living a thousand to one.

**Key Features:**
- Undead population in the hundreds of thousands
- Lich Council rules from the Bone Palace
- Living slaves kept for necromantic experiments
- Constant raids on nearby settlements
- Largest undead army in the world

**Current Threat:**
The liches are planning something. Increased military activity suggests a major offensive is coming.

---

#### THE DIMWOOD

**Type:** Shadow-corrupted forest

**Location:** Western lands, near Thornwood

**Description:**
Ancient forest still haunted by shadow corruption. Perpetual gloom under the canopy. Few elves remain here, and they're barely sane.

**Dangers:**
- Shadow-touched creatures
- Reality distortions
- Corrupted druids
- Lingering effects of the Darkening

---

#### THE MIDNIGHT SHORE

**Type:** Demon-plagued coastline

**Location:** Southern coast, former Tidecrown Kingdom

**Description:**
Coastal regions where the barrier between planes was damaged during the Darkening. Demons still raid from weakened planar boundaries. Fishing villages live in constant fear.

**Key Features:**
- Frequent demon incursions
- Planar rifts opening randomly
- Coastal fortresses constantly under siege
- Rich fishing grounds (if you survive)
- Ancient harbor ruins

---

#### THE BROKEN PEAKS

**Type:** Reclaimed dwarven surface holds

**Location:** Mountain range above the Underhearth

**Description:**
Surface dwarven fortresses slowly being reclaimed from monsters and bandits. The dwarves are fighting to reconnect with the surface world.

**Status:**
- Some holds retaken, others still fallen
- Constant battles with orcs, goblins, and worse
- Important for surface-Underhearth trade
- Sources of pre-Darkening weapons and artifacts

---

### OTHER NOTABLE LOCATIONS

**The Obsidian Spire**
- Tower of the Shadow Weaver (lich cult leader)
- Location unknown, but somewhere in the northern wastes
- Center of the cult's operations
- Heavily fortified with magic and undead guardians

**The Void Throne**
- Umbra's primary prison
- Somewhere in the deep places of the world
- Requires all seven Shadow-Crystals to access
- Final seal holding the Titan

**Azuremark City Ruins**
- Former capital of magical learning
- Ground zero of a Darkening epicenter
- Extremely dangerous but contains incredible magical treasures
- The University of High Magic lies in ruins
- Shadow corruption makes exploration nearly impossible

---

---

### ELVES

**Population Status:** Drastically reduced; considered endangered

The elven kingdoms suffered terribly during the Darkening. Their deep connection to nature made them particularly vulnerable to shadow corruption. Most of the great forests fell, and with them, the majority of elvenkind.

**Silvermere Survivors**

**Elven Characteristics:**
- Long-lived (can reach 750+ years)
- Many remember the Age of Ascension firsthand
- Resistant to disease and poison
- Natural affinity for magic and nature
- Carry deep sorrow for their lost civilization

---

### DWARVES

**Population Status:** Stable; underground realms fared better

Dwarven holds deep underground were partially shielded from the Darkening. While they still suffered losses, the dwarves emerged as one of the most intact civilizations.

**Deepstone Kingdom**
- Largest surviving dwarven realm
- Allied with the gnomes of the Underhearth
- Actively trading with surface settlements
- Producing weapons, armor, and tools
- Defending against underground threats (duergar, dark elves, aberrations)

**Surface Dwarves**
- Living in human communities or ruined dwarven surface fortresses

- Maintain clan ties to underground holds
- Sometimes serve as liaisons between surface and Underhearth

**Dwarven Culture:**
- Value craftsmanship, honor, and clan loyalty
- Excellent warriors and smiths
- Long memories; many hold grudges against those who abandoned them during the Darkening
- Religious devotion to ancestral gods
- Suspicious of arcane magic (but respect divine magic)

---

### GNOMES - THE ILLUMINATED ONES
*The Heroes of the Age of Reclamation*

**Population Status:** Recovering (~50,000, compared to millions before the Darkening)

**Origins:**
Created during the Age of Titans as a hybrid of elven magic and dwarven ingenuity to serve as magical technicians and ward-keepers. Their artificial origin grants unique resistance to corrupting magic—a blessing that would prove essential to their survival.

**Unique Abilities:**
- Resistance to shadow corruption and mind-affecting magic
- Can see and work with magical infrastructure (ley lines, wards, enchantments)
- Natural affinity for combining different magical traditions
- Extended lifespans (200-300 years) preserve institutional knowledge
- Faintly luminous eyes (side effect of practicing luminomancy)

**Historical Role**

*Age of Ascension:*
Gnomes designed and built the **Pillars of Heaven**—the great magical infrastructure that connected and protected the Seven Kingdoms. They established the **Luminous Guild**, maintaining all major magical infrastructure across the realm and serving as neutral diplomats between races.

*Age of Shadow - THE TRAGEDY:*
As the maintainers of the Pillars, gnomes were the Shadow Cult's primary targets during the Darkening. The gnomish capital **Brightspire** was completely destroyed in a coordinated assault. Approximately 80% of all gnomes died defending the Pillars from corruption. The survivors fled underground into the deepest dwarf holds, where their resistance to shadow magic proved crucial to survival.

*Age of Reclamation - THE HEROES:*
Gnomes emerged from the depths 50 years ago and immediately began restoration work. They reformed as **The Rekindlers**—dedicating themselves to restoring the Pillars and pushing back shadow corruption. Every major settlement now has a Rekindler enclave. Gnomes are universally respected as symbols of hope and defiance against darkness.

**Current Society**

**Organization:** The Rekindlers Guild (Headquarters: New Brightspire, built in the Underhearth)

**Philosophy:** *"Light must be maintained, never taken for granted. Every lamp lit is an act of defiance."*

**Status:** Honored guests everywhere. Free passage through all territories. Settlements actively compete to host Rekindler enclaves for the protection and prosperity they bring.

**Magic - Luminomancy:**
Gnomes practice a unique form of magic focused on light, protection, detection, and purification. This specialization developed from their role as Pillar maintainers and has proven essential in combating shadow corruption.

**Cultural Traits:**
- Serious about duty but maintain dark humor about survival
- Value light both literally and metaphorically
- Celebrate every sunset survived and dawn witnessed
- Keep meticulous records of everything
- Distrust hasty or reckless magic
- Wear symbols of light: lanterns, sun emblems, glowing crystals
- Traditional colors: white, gold, silver
- Many have taken on surnames related to light (Brightspark, Dawnkeeper, Lampwright)

**Gnomish Innovations:**
- Clockwork devices and automatons
- Improved metallurgy and alchemy
- Preservation techniques for books and artifacts
- Early steam power experiments
- Magical-mechanical hybrid devices
- Purification wards against shadow corruption
- Restored sections of the ancient Pillar network

**Campaign Relevance:**
Thornhollow likely has 2-3 gnomes maintaining village wards and keeping the surrounding area safe from shadow corruption. They serve as the village's connection to the wider Rekindler network and are treated with great respect by the locals.

---

### HALFLINGS

**Population Status:** Surviving, scattered

Halflings were always a minority race, living as travelers or in small agricultural communities. They've adapted well to the post-Darkening world.

**Characteristics:**

- Maintain close family bonds
- Value stories, songs, and comfort
- Excellent at going unnoticed

**Common Roles:**

## MAGIC IN THE SHATTERED KINGDOMS

### THE STATE OF MAGIC

**Before the Darkening:**
- Widespread and powerful
- Formal magical education at universities
- The Pillars (archmages) coordinated magical research
- Teleportation, divination, and powerful conjuration were common
- Magic items were relatively plentiful

**After the Darkening:**
- Most magical knowledge lost
- Few wizards survive with complete training
- Spellbooks are precious treasures
- Magic items are rare and highly valued
- Divine magic remains more stable (gods weren't affected)
- Many fear arcane magic, blaming it for the Darkening

**Current Magic Users:**

**Wizards:**
- Rare and usually self-taught from recovered spellbooks
- Most know only 1st-3rd level spells
- High-level wizards are legends
- Often work with the Rekindlers
- Viewed with suspicion by common folk

**Clerics:**
- More common than wizards
- Gods still answer prayers (unlike the absent Pillars)
- Essential to communities for healing and protection
- Multiple pantheons exist
- Divine magic seen as safer than arcane

**Druids:**
- Connect to primal nature spirits
- Unaffected by the collapse of arcane infrastructure
- Working to heal corrupted lands
- Often elves or gnomes

**Illusionists:**
- Rare specialist wizards
- Vaelith the Mirage-Weaver was a master illusionist
- Their magic is misunderstood and feared
- Can be powerful if trained properly

---

### SHADOW MAGIC

**Nature:**
Shadow magic is not inherently evil, but it is dangerous and corrupting. It draws power from the plane of shadow and from Umbra's essence.

**Effects of Shadow Corruption:**
- Physical: pallor, sunken eyes, cold touch
- Mental: paranoia, detachment, loss of empathy
- Spiritual: disconnection from positive energy
- Gradual transformation into shadow-touched creatures

**Uses:**
- Darkness and illusion spells
- Necromancy (animating shadows)
- Draining life force
- Traveling through shadows
- Corrupting living creatures

**Vaelith's Research:**
Vaelith the Mirage-Weaver attempted to purify shadow magic, believing it could be cleansed and used safely. His experiments failed catastrophically, killing his apprentice Talven and creating a Shadow-Crystal. However, his research may hold the key to understanding shadow corruption.

**The Shadow-Crystals:**
These seven artifacts are fragments of Umbra's prison. They:
- Emanate shadow corruption
- Grant power to wielders (at a cost)
- Can be used as keys to Umbra's prison
- Connect to each other (can sense proximity)
- Whisper in Deep Speech to those who carry them
- May be able to be purified or destroyed (risky)

---

## RELIGION & BELIEFS

### THE ROLE OF ADVENTURERS

In the Age of Reclamation, adventurers are not glory-seekers or treasure hunters alone—they are essential to survival.

**Adventurers:**
- Clear ruins so settlements can expand
- Recover magical knowledge and artifacts
- Defend villages from monster raids
- Investigate mysterious threats
- Connect isolated communities
- Inspire hope through their deeds

**Without Adventurers:**
- Monsters overrun settlements
- Knowledge remains lost in ruins
- Cults operate unchallenged
- Trade routes stay closed
- Darkness spreads unchecked

## EPILOGUE: A WORLD OF DARK HOPE

The Shattered Kingdoms is a world broken but not defeated. The Age of Reclamation is a time of struggle, but also opportunity. Every ruin cleared, every monster slain, every shadow purified brings the world one step closer to recovery.

The heroes who explore the Ruined Tower of Vaelith the Mirage-Weaver are part of this larger story. The Shadow-Crystal they may find there connects them to the deepest mysteries of the Darkening and to the fate of the world itself.

Will they become the champions who prevent a second Darkening? Will they help rebuild civilization? Or will they fall to shadow corruption like so many before them?

In the Shattered Kingdoms, heroes are desperately needed.

**The world's fate may rest in their hands.**
