## DM REMINDERS

- Describe what players see, hear, smell
- Ask "What do you do?" not "Roll Perception"
- Reward creativity and clever thinking
- Roll dice in the open for trust
- Say "Yes, and..." when possible
- Let consequences happen - death is real
- Time pressure creates tension (torches burn out!)
- Award XP for treasure AND avoiding combat
- Keep combat moving - decide and roll!
- Have fun! Your enthusiasm matters most
