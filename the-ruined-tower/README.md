# THE RUINED TOWER - CAMPAIGN OVERVIEW

## SETTING

**Location:** Village of Thornhollow, small farming community
**Season:** Late autumn, harvest time
**Atmosphere:** Worried villagers, disappearing livestock, mysterious lights on the hill

---

## THE HOOK

Livestock has been disappearing from Thornhollow over the past two weeks. Strange lights have been seen at the old ruins of a wizard's tower on the nearby hill. Mayor Grevik offers 100 gold pieces to investigate and stop the threat.

---

## THE DUNGEON - THE RUINED TOWER

**History:** Built ~40 years ago by Vaelith the Mirage-Weaver, a master illusionist researching shadow magic from the Age of Shadow. Tower collapsed in a catastrophic ritual failure ~30 years ago when Vaelith attempted to purify shadow corruption. His apprentice Talven died in the ritual, and the magical backlash destroyed the tower. Vaelith fled, mad with guilt, and died in the wilderness. Ruins have been abandoned until recently.

**Current Threat:** Goblins moved in 2 weeks ago, using it as a base for raids. Led by Grisk the Snatcher. They are unaware of the secret ritual chamber below.

**Structure:** 6 visible rooms across 2 levels (ground floor partially collapsed, lower level intact) + 1 hidden ritual chamber beneath the library

**Trap Philosophy:** Goblins are cunning and paranoid - they've set crude but effective traps to protect their lair and warn of intruders.

## ROOM 7 - SECRET RITUAL CHAMBER (OPTIONAL CONTENT)

**Access:** Secret door in Room 2 (Library), behind collapsed bookshelf on north wall
**Password:** "Lux Memoriae" (found in spellbook margin notes OR journal page)
**Alternative:** *Detect Magic* + *Read Magic* can reveal and open the door

### THE DESCENT
Narrow stone spiral staircase descends 20 feet. Walls carved with protective runes (now failing). Purple-black stains seep through cracks. Temperature drops noticeably. Faint whispering can be heard.

### CHAMBER DESCRIPTION
- **Size:** 20' × 20' underground chamber
- **Ceiling:** 12' high, carved with astronomical charts
- **Walls:** Covered in arcane formulae in chalk and dried blood
- **Floor:** Large ritual circle (10' diameter) in center, inscribed with shadow runes
- **Lighting:** Eerie purple phosphorescence from the circle (equivalent to torchlight)
- **Atmosphere:** Constant low whisper in unknown language, smell of decay and ozone

### THE GUARDIAN: SHADOW-TOUCHED SKELETON
*The reanimated corpse of Talven, Vaelith's apprentice, corrupted by failed shadow purification ritual*

**AC:** 7 | **HD:** 1+2 (8 hp) | **Move:** 12" | **Attacks:** 1 claw (1d4 + chill touch)

**Special Abilities:**
- **Chill Touch:** On hit, Save vs. Paralysis or -1 to hit next round
- **Shadow Whispers:** Those in room Save vs. Magic each round or -1 to hit (cumulative, max -3)
- **Vulnerable to Bludgeoning:** Takes +1 damage per die from crushing weapons
- **Immune to Sleep/Charm**

**Tactics:** Guards ritual circle aggressively, focuses on spellcasters first, fights to destruction

**XP Value:** 35 XP

### TREASURE
**On the Skeleton:**
- Talven's Signet Ring (silver, engraved "T.M.") - 10 gp
- Shadow-Crystal (black crystal shard in ribcage, emanates faint dread) - 50 gp to right buyer

**On the Workbench:**
- Vaelith's Research Notes (partially burned journal describing shadow magic research, the Darkening, Pillars failing, final entry about Talven)
- Alchemical Components - 20 gp total
- Minor Scroll: *Protection from Evil* (1 use)

**Hidden in Secret Compartment (Search workbench):**
- Darkened Grimoire (spellbook with *Darkness 15' Radius*, *Phantasmal Force*, shadow magic theory)
- 50 gp in old coins
- Letter from "Master Gearheart" (gnome elder) warning Vaelith about shadow research dangers

### WHAT HAPPENED HERE
Vaelith attempted to purify shadow corruption through ritual magic. His apprentice Talven volunteered. The ritual failed, killing Talven and animating his corpse with shadow magic. The backlash caused the tower to collapse. Vaelith fled, consumed by guilt, and died in the wilderness. The chamber remained sealed for 30 years.

### WORLD CONNECTION
This chamber connects the campaign to **The Shattered Kingdoms** world history:
- The Age of Shadow and the Darkening (100 years ago)
- Gnome Rekindlers who study shadow corruption
- Master Gearheart (267-year-old gnome elder in the Underhearth)
- Ongoing threat of shadow magic corruption
- Question of whether shadow magic can be purified

### DM NOTES
- This is **optional endgame content** for observant players
- Rewards thorough exploration with lore, treasure, and world-building
- Shadow-Touched Skeleton is challenging but fair for level 1 party
- Emphasize horror atmosphere: whispering, cold, wrongness
- Finding this chamber reveals the TRUE story of the tower's collapse
- Sets up Vaelith as tragic figure, not evil wizard
- Provides hooks to larger campaign world
