Players first must find someone in the dungeons of the citadel who knows something about the shadow crystal shards. They only get a
 piece of the picture, but learn that the shard they found in Vaelith's tower came from the depths of Dimwood. They can learn more from Ghundla
r the Dwarf in Ubechlode. Apparently his brother, now dead, was one of the companions that came back from Dimwood alive with the shard.
